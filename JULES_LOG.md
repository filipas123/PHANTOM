## [2026-05-27] — Session 1
**What I decided to work on:** I chose to perform a Bug Hunt focusing on unhandled promise rejections and potential WebSocket crashes. I noticed that several asynchronous route handlers in the Express backend lacked `try/catch` wrappers, which in Express 4 can lead to unhandled promise rejections crashing the application. Additionally, the WebSocket `onmessage` handler in the frontend blindly parsed incoming JSON without a `try/catch`, posing a risk of UI crashes if malformed data was received.
**What I built/fixed:**
- Wrapped the asynchronous `/api/system/info` route handler in `server/routes/api.js` in a `try/catch` block.
- Wrapped the asynchronous `/api/settings/test` route handler in `server/routes/api.js` in a `try/catch` block.
- Added a `try/catch` block around `JSON.parse(event.data)` inside the WebSocket `onmessage` handler in `frontend/js/app.js` to gracefully catch and log parsing errors.
**Files changed:**
- `server/routes/api.js`
- `frontend/js/app.js`
**Tests:** 11 passed / 0 added

## YYYY-MM-DD
**Tasks Completed:**
- Added Telegram bot integration using `node-telegram-bot-api`.
- Created `server/telegram/bot.js` for bot logic and `server/telegram/session.js` for session management.
- Integrated bot start into `server/index.js` based on `config.telegram`.
- Updated `server/config.js` and `.env.example` to support `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and `TELEGRAM_USER_ID`.
- Added `/api/telegram/status` and `/api/telegram/restart` API endpoints.
- Added Telegram configuration UI in `frontend/index.html` and logic in `frontend/js/settings.js` with pulse animation in `frontend/css/styles.css`.
- Wrote tests in `tests/telegram.test.js` to verify bot commands, session handling, and message filtering.

**Testing:**
- All tests pass (`npm test`).
- Lint checks completed (`npm run lint`).
